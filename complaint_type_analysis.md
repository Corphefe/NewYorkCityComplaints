The most common complaint in January-February was Illegal Parking.

This complaint was filed most in Brooklyn then Queens. The Bronx had half the number of complains as in Queens and is closly followed by Manhatten. Staten Island has comparatively few illegal parking complaints.
The counts for this complaint where slightly higher in each borough (Queens had the largest increase but not enough to surpass Brooklyn) in June-July suggesting some seasonal increase.
However, the distribution of this complain is largely the same over the boroughs.
