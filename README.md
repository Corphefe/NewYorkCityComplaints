# NewYorkCityComplaints
Data Science Project to generate interactive visualizations for NYC zip code discrepencies

## Data
THe Dataset for this project is from NYC Open Data's 311 call database. This can be found at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9. For the puposes of this project, only the 2024 incidents were used.

## Project
Using the 311 data, I created a Bokeh interactive that charts 311 complaints over time for a choice of ZIP code. Data was parsed using argparse CLI's, and graphics were generated on jupyter.
